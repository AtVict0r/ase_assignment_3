# Simple React App

This project is a simple React application created for the ASE Boot Camp Assignment 3. The application features a dynamic web page with various components, each styled with unique borders and background colors.

## Features

- **Dynamic Header**: Displays information based on the user's age, and a logo.
- **Functional Navigation Bar**: Allows users to navigate through different sections of the app.
- **Main Content Area**: Contains detailed information relevant to the app's purpose.
- **Footer**: Includes copyright information and additional links.

## Layout

The layout consists of the following components:
- Header Component
- Navbar Component
- Main Component
- Footer Component

Each component is designed to show its own border and background color style, enhancing the visual hierarchy and user experience.

## Optional Enhancement

- A 3 by 1 layout has been implemented to replace the original image placeholder.

## Schedule Component (Example)

Here's an example of how the schedule component displays information:

```
Month Day Time DMV Staff

Nov 18 9:00AM Lucas Potter
```
